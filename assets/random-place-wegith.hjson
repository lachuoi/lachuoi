# This is the current weighted city/country chart. Some countries have much
# larger populations than others. The bot selects cities where the population
# is greater than the base_population and multiplies its population by the
# given weighted factor. For example, India, the country with the largest
# population as of 2025, will get a lower weight factor. As a result, we have
# less chance of picking India (unless we mostly have cities in India).
